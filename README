This is a Star Wars trivia game that I wrote in Pascal when I was 15 years old
in about 1994.  Amazingly, it still compiles and runs :-)

For your best experience, use a terminal that is exactly 25 characters tall,
and at least 160 characters wide (it uses some double-byte utf-8 characters
that will probably mangle your display).

You can build and run using:
	$ make && ./swline

Or, you can build and run the Docker container:
	$ sudo docker build .
	$ sudo docker run -t -i <ID>

Or, download and run the Docker contianer:
	$ sudo docker pull kirkland/swline
	$ sudo docker run -t -i kirkland/swline

Note that the -t and the -i are essential!
